# FRIDA plots
This is a collection of the scripts we use to create figures for the "FRIDA Birds-Eye" paper, to make sure they use similar layouts.

### General Notes
- The current TEMPLATE files are just first versions. Once we find the desired layouts, we should add and adapt these files.
- In all figures of costs, use Giga$(2021) instead of b$ or bc$
- We want to have grid lines in line plots (Cecilie).

### To-Do's
- we want to plot the areas of the land-use types in km^2 instead of Mha
- (should we really call it habitable land? But this is the FAO standard ...)
- in the food production figures, distinguish between aquatic and other animal shares
- in the plot of water usage, plot the unsustainable water withdrawal as a line on top of the stacked area chart with agri. and non-agri. water withdrawal
