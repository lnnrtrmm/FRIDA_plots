# FRIDA plots
This is a collection of the scripts we use to create figures for the "FRIDA Birds-Eye" paper, to make sure they use similar layouts. The output of a FRIDA ensemble should be stored in the "FRIDA_output" folder. Not included in repo because of file sizes. If access to Levante at DKRZ exists, these files can be copied using the scripts in that folder.

### General Notes
- The current TEMPLATE files are just first versions. Once we find the desired layouts, we should add and adapt these files.

### To-Do's
- Clean up the energy cycle notebook
