# FRIDA plots
This is a collection of the scripts we use to create figures for the "FRIDA Birds-Eye" paper, to make sure they use similar schemes.

### General Notes
- in all figures of costs, use Giga$(2021) instead of b$ or bc$
- we want to have grid lines in line plots

### To-Do's
- we want to plot the areas of the land-use types in km^2 instead of Mha
- (should we really call it habitable land? But this is the FAO standard ...)
- in the food production figures, distinguish between aquatic and other animal shares
- in the plot of water usage, plot the unsustainable water withdrawal as a line on top of the stacked area chart with agri. and non-agri. water withdrawal
