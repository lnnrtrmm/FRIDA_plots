# FRIDA plots

This is a repository to collect scripts to create figures and process output from a [FRIDA](https://github.com/metno/WorldTransFRIDA) ensemble. FRIDA is a new integrated assessment model built within the WorldTrans project. WorldTrans is funded by "European Union’s Horizon 2.5 – Climate Energy and Mobility programme" under grant agreement No. 101081661

The output of a FRIDA ensemble should be stored in the "FRIDA_output" folder, it is not included in this repo because of file sizes. If access to Levante at DKRZ exists, these files can be copied using the scripts in that folder.

### General Notes
- The current TEMPLATE files are just first versions. Once we find the desired layouts, we should add and adapt these files.
